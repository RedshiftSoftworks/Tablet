# LuaEncode
Utility Function for Optimal Serialization of Lua Tables in Luau/Lua 5.1+

___

## About & Features
This is a simple utility function developers can use for **serialization** of [Luau](https://luau-lang.org)/[Lua](https://lua.org) tables/data-structures. This script natively supports both Luau, and Lua 5.1+.

### Features:
- Full serialization and output of basic types `number`, `string`, `table`, `boolean`, and `nil` for keys/values.
- "Pretty Printing" & custom indentation config.
- **(Currently Unimplemented)** `typeof()` support for custom Roblox datatypes such as `Instance`, `UDim`, `Vector`, `DateTime`, etc..
- Raw key/value set with `FunctionsReturnRaw`. (See API below for more info)

## Installation
- ### GitHub Releases
    You can download the [`LuaEncode.lua`](https://github.com/regginator/LuaEncode/releases/latest/download/LuaEncode.lua) or [`LuaEncode.rbxm`](https://github.com/regginator/LuaEncode/releases/latest/download/LuaEncode.rbxm) module for the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/regginator/LuaEncode/releases/latest), and immediately use the module!
- ### Rojo/Wally
    If you're familiar with [Rojo](https://rojo.space) or [Wally](https://wally.run), you can just clone the repository use those tools to build the module just how you would with anything else.

    - Rojo
        ```sh
        rojo build default.project.json -o LuaEncode.rbxm
        ```
    - In Your Project Deps w/ Wally
        ```toml
        [dependencies]
        LuaEncode = "regginator/luaencode@0.1.0"
        ```
- ### Git Submodule
    If you're familiar with [Git Submodules](https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255), you can import the repo into your project as per use case.

## Usage
```lua
-- Basic usage example
-- github.com/regginator/LuaEncode

local LuaEncode = require(script.LuaEncode)

local SomeTable = {
    foo = "bar",
    baz = {
        ["hi mom"] = "hello world",
        [5] = "qux",
        [{123, 456, 789}] = {
            1,
            2,
            "goodbye"
        },
        syn = "tax",
        "example",
    },
}

local Encoded = LuaEncode({
    Table = SomeTable,
    FunctionsReturnRaw = true, -- `false` by default
    PrettyPrint = true, -- `false` by default
    IndentCount = 4, -- `0` by default
})

print(Encoded)
```

Expected Output:
```lua
{
    baz = {
        "example",
        syn = "tax",
        [{123, 456, 789}] = {
            1,
            2,
            "goodbye"
        },
        [5] = "qux",
        ["hi mom"] = "hello world"
    },
    foo = "bar"
}
```

<string> LuaEncode(<table?: {}> args)
```
| Argument | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Table | `<table?: {}>` | Input table to serialize and return. |
| FunctionsReturnRaw | `<bool?: false>` | If functions in said table return back a "raw" value to place in the output as the key/value. |
| PrettyPrint | `<bool?: false>` | Whether or not the output should use "pretty printing". |
| IndentCount | `<number?: 0>` | The amount of "spaces" that should be indented per entry. |
